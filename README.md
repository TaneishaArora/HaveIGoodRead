# Have I (Good)Read This?

## Inspiration
I wandered into [Booksmith](https://share.google/yopYq7kRiUv6VTwCG) on my way home from the gym. While browsing the shelves, I noticed a familiar cover:

I had a feeling that this was an unreleased book I'd shelved away on [my Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7928178-taneisha-arora) account. To confirm said feeling, I did the following:
1) Unlocked my phone.
2) Searched for the GoodReads app.
3) Typed in the title on the familiar looking cover into the Goodreads search box
4) Looked at shelf the book was in (spoiler: it was indeed in my "Want to Read" shelf)

This process felt LONG. I wanted to minimize the lag time between me wondering what Goodreads shelf this book I'd seen at the bookstore was in, and actually finding out.

I wanted to be able to literally point my phone at the book and have Goodreads tell me what shelf the book belonged to!

And so... here we are, making that possible.

> **Update** : At the time of writing this (which is about 2 weeks after the inspiration story you read above took place), I opened up my Goodreads app to re-live the painful experience described above. While doing so, I saw a 📷 icon in in the search box and thought to myself: "Oh shit. -_-. The feature I wanted to build already exists." HOWEVER when I actually used it, it was just as friction-ful as the text box flow... soooooo we MARCH ONWARDS!
